Overview

This provides the data and the scripts to explore the genetics underlying hybrid effect variation in a F2 population of pigs. The F2 was developed from a cross between the European Large White (LW) boars and East Asian Min (MIN) sows.

1. The phenotypic data for the LW-MIN F2 popualtion
  All the F2 individuals were raised without any directional selection imposed by humans, and the phenotypes of the F2 are expected to vary and are exposed to natural selection. A total of 135 traits were collected in the F2 population.
